# NoShowAppointments_DataAnalysisProject

## This was a data analysis project as a part of Udacity data analysis nanodegree

In this project I investigated No Show Doctors Appointments and from the data I extracted multiple insights.

The obesrvations that were extracted from the data:

- People who do not show up for the appointments tend to schedule it earlier
- The mean age for people who did not show up is less than the mean of people who showed up.
- People with medical conditions tend to show up for appointments more. This might be linked to the age metric. 
- Counterintuitively, the percentage of people who showed up and got the message is less than the percentage of people who did not show up and got the message. However, this metric might not be clear according to things like: when the message was received, did the person see it and others.
